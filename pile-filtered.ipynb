What is the difference between coding and programming to you?  Do you consider CSS and HTML to be coding?  It sounds like you are saying \"I don\\'t understand data structures and algorithms well\" means \"I\\'m not confident in programming\".  \\n\\nIn a roundabout way, maybe CS could help you.  For years, CS majors didn\\'t get taught web development.  This means you could learn programming without web development (which is a form of programming, at least Javascript).  Students learned Pascal or C++ or Java or Python.   All of this could be learned without web development.   This is meant as a caution, i.e., just because you learn data structures and algorithms doesn\\'t mean you will learn how to write great web applications.  It\\'s more like, if \\nYhcti: So if you said write a function, I could do it, but if you said build a calculator, I\\'d know a little, but not much. Basically what I mean is I know the individual syntax/concepts on their own, but putting them together into a project, or even knowing what project to build, and how to build it, is where I\\'m really stuck.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve done several courses for front-end and even Python, so I\\'m happy writing functions, loops, statements etc in both, only thing I\\'m not comfortable on yet is Classes, which is still a learning process.\\nCodeTinkerer: It could be that a project is still a little too big for you to work on.  I often suggest writing simple games like Hangman, Connect 4, Tic-Tac-Toe.  Even some of these games are a bit complicated (remove graphics from these games, keep it text-based).\\n\\nSome courses like edX CS50 have short programs you can write (it\\'s in C), as well as MOOC.fi (it\\'s in Java).  So you might be able to find a free online course to copy projects from.  For Python there\\'s a free book called \"Automate the Boring Stuff\" which teaches basic Python for half the book, and let\\'s you do some tasks for the rest of the book.\\n\\nHard to say if that would appeal to you or not.\\nYhcti: To be honest Ill try anything that helps! As an example of what Ive done so far. All I have done is colt steele and Angela yus udemy courses, and Im now doing Codecademy which will show me JavaScript beginner, intermediate then react. I think theres also one to build a website using all 3 but I havent looked into it yet.\\n\\nI dont want to get stuck in tutorial hell but if Codecademy is good Ill keep going until Im comfortable. I gave myself 6 months from today to start applying for jobs as Ive already spent a year on/off struggling\\nCodeTinkerer: Do you talk to the recruiters if they\\'ve been hired?  I wonder if they would be able to assess your skills and how far they think you need to be or not.  Part of it is just knowing enough programming in general, but some people, even with a CS degree, can go into a job and feel intimidated (impostor syndrome).\\n\\nThe reason is knowing how to program is something of a general skill which you have to adapt to the place you work, and usually that requires the new employee has to be able to communicate (you may not have that problem) that they are having issues, as well as to take notes, and remember things.\\n\\nI work with university students who help program part time, but many of them (not yet with a degree) feel shy to ask for help, so they tend to work \\nYhcti: I think its more of what is the right question to ask etc.. discipline is a huge issue for me too, but yea, I guess I just need to hammer away at it until it clicks, then advance and add more difficulty until that clicks, repeat..\\nCodeTinkerer: Yeah, I think the frustrating part is just hammering it in doesn\\'t seem to work for some people, at least, for some concepts.  They\\'d be better off finding a mentor who can explain things in a clear way.\\n\\nMany things in life, you can probably do what you\\'re saying, but it can be difficult to get over the hump sometimes.\\nYhcti: I agree. Im there hehe. Ive done the tutorials for the basics, now Im at that stuck stage of what do I build, how do I build it, where do I build it?!\\nCodeTinkerer: Are there any small enhancements you could add, no matter how basic?  Or can you look at a similar tutorial, and then see how you could combine features of both things?  You can\\'t have to come up with anything deep, just something a little different.\\n\\nCombining ideas from two similar projects could be useful to help you understand the material better.\\n\\n\\n', 'In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called dataisbeautiful:\\nLlamahDuck: It\\'s sad Australia didn\\'t make this list as we have so much potential.

It\\'s pop density is 27000 per sq mile. \\n\\nSo lets extrapolate that out, China is about ~1000x bigger in space (but that\\'s a rough estimate).\\n\\nSo even during the initial outbreak it\\'ll get 300k...a day. \\n\\nDid they lock it down that quickly? Meaning its one day maybe. BUt I woudl highly doubt it given the virus itself often took 14 days to show symptoms.\\n\\nEdit: However, to be clear you\\'d have to do a much more detailed analysis than \\nExistentialistMonkey: China has a lot of empty space, and it\\'s only as densely populated as NYC in a few cities (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan)\\n\\nAnd their authoritarian response to covid was very effective. I\\'m not saying those numbers are legitimate, but I\\'m saying that their numbers are definitely lower than most of reddit is claiming it to be. Their strict lockdowns and mandatory quarantines worked. We never had a strict lockdown in the US, and we never had mandatory quarantines.\\njulbull73: I agree US bungled it. \\n\\nBut those four cities you listed alone would\\'ve gotten up over 300k deaths within days of outbreak. Those four cities are &gt; 50% the entire US population. \\n\\nAgain you can keep beating China\\'s \"amazing\" response thanks to  totalitarianism all you want. \\n\\nBasic math STILL has you in the 300k+ dead range in the first few weeks ALONE.\\n\\n\\n', \"In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called dataisbeautiful:\\nLikeWolvesDo: If you are currently holding Dogecoin for the love of god sell.

[The Virtual Foundry](https://www.thevirtualfoundry.com/) makes a filament that's basically powdered metal held together with a plastic binder, so you can print with that filament and then put the part in a sintering kiln to burn off the binder and fuse the metal powder into a solid object.\\nazrael4h: That's neat! If I ever get around to buying a 3D printer, that'll be the thing to use. I actually have access to a kiln at work that we use for a DOT test on occasion. 1000C should be plenty to burn away the plastic binder; heck it works on asphalt cement so plastic should be fine.\\nKallistiTMP: Yeah, sintering temp is a little higher for [some of the metals](https://www.thevirtualfoundry.com/products), but 1000C will do aluminum and bronze, and if you can push it a little to ~1300C then you can do iron, stainless steel, inconel, titanium, etc.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, if you only need soft/low melting point metals like aluminum and bronze, then you can do Lost PLA casting from 3D printed objects as well, which is even easier.

Many of the Chinese made phones for example lack compatible LTE bands entirely, or only have two bands compatible with a single US carrier, which is even further whittled down by carrier whitelisting.

Replying to me saying \"hur dur they get summer vacation\" doesn\\'t really change that fact.\\nkcaboom: Daughter of a teacher here, they are 100% under paid and over worked, but their annual salary does come with 2 weeks at Christmas, a week spring break, federal holidays and approximately 2 months off over the summer \\n\\nSo sometimes its hard to think about the annual salary. I think we should show this in hourly wages and then talk about the hundreds of unpaid hours of work teachers do.\\na-c-p-a: Though a lot of teachers are working summers anyway  getting the season off is more burden than perk when the salary is so little\\nTheCrimsonDagger: My mom is retiring as a teacher this year and I can tell you this is incorrect. They work about a week after school ends to tie up loose ends and clean up the room then about a week before it starts to get ready. \\n\\nA lot of the problem with teacher salaries is that experienced teachers dont really get paid much more than new ones. The only way to get a meaningful wage increase as a teacher is to stop teaching and move into administration. Its super fucked.\\nGuerilladust: What about the pensions. Why is that not taken into account. I probably made more at some of my jobs and had to save VASTLY more because I have no pension whereas Teachers can spend far more of their take home pay knowing that when they retire they are basically taken care of.\\nDabeeeeeeed: Teacher here. About 18% of my paycheck is gone to retirement without my control (before taxes). Pensions arent free, there are pros and cons.\\nBuscemis_eyeballs: I fucking WISH I could surrender 18 of my income and in return get a guaranteed check until I die. Its going to be impossible for my generation to save enough to retire. Even a modest life at 50k a year will take millions to maintain if you plan to not die right after retirement.\\nKickingPugilist: Lol I\\'d rather keep the 18% that I can put away as I see fit than pay into a pension that lord knows if it\\'ll exist by the time I retire.\\n\\nSome state pensions are TENS of BILLIONS in debt.\\nBuscemis_eyeballs: You\\'ll never get a better return on your investment with that 18% in the market.\\n\\nShit, I would pay 20% to get a pension if I could.\\n\\n\\n', \"In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called dataisbeautiful:\\n[deleted]: [deleted]\\nBendy_McBendyThumb: And Germany are happy to break the rules of the vaccine agreement on top!

Reproducibility is just: under the same conditions, you get the same results. But this gets fuzzy under the impact of randomness in all our work. Is running the experiment and getting within 1% test accuracy reproducible? That would put you in the lower middle of the pack for many benchmarks.

Stolen items were never the intended use case.\\nUniqueHairdo: I mean lost items can easily become stolen items. So someone didnt actively steal it from you, but found your lost item and  decide to turf the tracking tag and keep the item.\\nDarthPneumono: I mean... but they could just do that anyway, right? The airtag being there doesn\\'t make it any more or less likely for the item to be stolen.\\n\\nedit: And to be clear, whether Apple makes this change or not, it\\'s the same situation.

I was trying to use http://localhost and I didn\\'t realize both browsers automatically changed it to https://localhost because they hide the https://. That whole fucking time, all I needed was an SSL certificate but I had no idea because they hid that info from me.\\nnandryshak: &gt; That whole fucking time, all I needed was an SSL certificate but I had no idea because they hid that info from me. \\n\\nWell, that\\'s not entirely true. They don\\'t really hide the information from you. Without TLS, Firefox displays [a lock with a red slash through it](https://i.imgur.com/M8ukVWX.png), and Chrome displays [an exclamation mark in a warning triangle with the words \"not secure\"](https://i.imgur.com/uHREDQ2.png). If a site is using TLS, both display [a lock](https://i.imgur.com/qNO0RNZ.png), and [Firefox displays \"https\" in the address bar](https://i.imgur.com/7IMwvNe.png). If all that didn\\'t help you, I don\\'t think showing http would\\'ve either.\\nkai_wulf: Noticing the browser change it from http to https is precisely what made me think of enabling SSL. I was using WordPress and getting the WSoD. There were no notifications in the actual browser that it wasn\\'t connecting. In addition, another WordPress site I had set up on my system worked just fine. I just happened to be working with a WordPress site running on WPEngine with extra SSL configuration in wp-config.php (I thought commenting that out would be sufficient since I had no intentions of messing around with SSL anyway). It wasn\\'t until I noticed the browser changing the protocol that it occured to me what was going on.\\nnandryshak: You\\'re still wrong though. I see you edited your original comment to clarify:\\n\\n&gt; I didn\\'t realize both browsers automatically changed it to https://localhost because they hide the https://\\n\\nFirefox does *not* hide the https, as you can see in my screenshot. And neither of the browsers automatically change http to https, as you can see in my screenshot where I\\'m visiting an http site (I did not explicitly type http). Especially not for localhost.\\n\\nIf I try to visit a localhost website that isn\\'t running https by typing https, I get an SSL error on both browsers. \\n\\nThis sounds like misconfiguration on your end.\\nkai_wulf: I\\'m on a rolling release Linux distro so I have one of the most recent Firefox version (v70 something). If you\\'re using that edition of Firefox, don\\'t have SSL set up on your system and attempt to connect to http://localhost, it will change it to https and it will hide everything else but just plain \"localhost\". Trying to connect to a WordPress site and getting WSoD might have something to do with it too. I spent hours dealing with it.\\nnandryshak: Okay, but I connect to http://localhost with Firefox Developer Edition (i.e. beta, which is on v90 btw) and Chrome every day for work on Arch Linux. What you\\'re claiming is just not the case, and I don\\'t think it\\'s ever been the case. I\\'m not saying this problem didn\\'t happen to you, I\\'m saying that the browsers did not cause it, and if there is an error then the browsers give you as much information as they can about it.\\nkai_wulf: When I\\'m able to connect, the browser shows the protocol and everything. When it doesn\\'t connect and fell back to the WSoD, the browser hid https://. I noticed it change from http to https briefly because it still displayed them when trying to connect. It wasn\\'t until after connection failed that https was hidden. I explained that in my OP.\\nnandryshak: I don\\'t understand why what I\\'m saying is not getting through to you. **Firefox does not hide https in the address bar, even for localhost. Neither browser redirects from http to https automatically. This problem is not the browsers\\' fault.** \\n\\nYou are simply misremembering or misunderstanding what happened to you, that\\'s all there is to it. Feel free to try to reproduce the problem, but I\\'m telling you that you won\\'t be able to because it just does not happen the way you\\'re describing.\\nkai_wulf: It\\'s not me, it\\'s you not listening. Other people have had this same issue.\\n\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38754131/firefox-redirects-localhost-to-https\\n\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/53093537/how-do-i-stop-firefox-from-forcing-https-on-local-development-server\\nnandryshak: Like I said, I\\'m not saying you didn\\'t encounter the problem. I said the browsers danielleparker@example.com. And even if you did get redirected from localhost to https://localhost, *Firefox still displays https in the address bar no matter what, even for localhost*, contrary to what you claimed. And both browsers would have given you security errors. \\n\\nFeel free to try to reproduce the problem, because I couldn\\'t, even after putting https://localhost in my history and trying to visit just localhost like the one stackoverflow user encountered.\\n\\nedit: also, now that you\\'ve edited your comment, it doesn\\'t make sense. You said \"all I needed was an SSL certificate\", but if you\\'re developing on localhost, why would you need an SSL certificate? What domain name would you \\nkai_wulf: You\\'re wrong, Firefox does not display \"https://localhost\" if it can\\'t connect to a local server. It defaults to displaying plain old \"localhost\" and hides https://. You aren\\'t understanding what the problem is.\\nnandryshak: I mean I checked it while we were having this conversation and it didn\\'t hide it. Plus, *even if* they redirect AND hide it, both browsers gave me security errors when trying to connect to https on localhost because of certificate errors.\\nkai_wulf: The screen didn\\'t alert me to security errors because it went to the \"White Screen of Death\". In WordPress, that means the screen is completely white. No errors or anything. It\\'s rather frustrating. WPEngine had many extra features in the wp-config.php file, which only added to the confusion (some of which were security related). My guess is localhost connected to the WordPress site but was halted before anything could be rendered. Because it connected, Firefox hid the https:// and only showed me \"localhost\", thus leaving me in the dark as to what was going on.\\n\\n\\n', 'In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called apple:\\nfatal_horizon: From https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/\\n\\nAvailable on MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2019 and later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac mini (2020 and later), Mac Pro (2019), iPhone 7 and later, iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).

Yes, if youre shipping it directly. But people prefer prime shipping so far more of these sales are distributed from Amazons fba warehouses and in those cases 3rd party sellers dont get an address either.

Installed both CLISP and SBCL via MacPorts.\\nagrostis: In CLisp, it seems to depend on whether you run it as a script or pass the expression to the interactive read-eval-print loop. Try putting ``(print +)`` in a file, say, pp.lisp, and running it as a script, the way it\\'s done in the tutorial (``clisp pp.lisp``).\\n\\nNot that it mattered a lot. The ``(cond )`` code in the tutorial is incorrect, in the sense that it doesn\\'t do what it\\'s intended to do. The value that the variable ``+`` shall have at the time of the evaluation of ``(cond )`` can\\'t be predicted. That is, evaluating ``(cond )`` results in what the Common Lisp standard calls unspecified consequences. It may succeed, it may fail, and which way it goes is happenstance.\\n\\n**Upd.:** Just for the sake of completeness, the more or less correct way to write \\ncurious_practice: Thank you so much. I will try this. Just one question: shouldnt the last line add (+ 0 to the return value?\\nagrostis: No problem. Regarding ``(+ 0 )``, it can be written that way, but it\\'s strictly gratuitous.

Its pretty clunky and unforgiving with very limited dynamic features\\ntheargyle: Ive been splitting my time fairly evenly between Ruby, Python (both as dynamic as you can get), and Swift. Swift is the language I *want* to program in - the amount of bugs the language prevents you from introducing is really significant.\\n\\nAs for clunky - I think thats about muscle memory more than anything. Took me a while to get into the flow of Swift, but as I said, I dont want to use anything else these days.\\nzaitsman: My go to is c#. It allows you to be as statically typed as swift and almost as dynamic as javascript, when needed.\\ndippnerd: Ive been a c# dev for 10+ years and it has its strengths, but boy does it hit a wall for a lot of things Swift does super well. Swift enums are just *so powerful* compared to c# for one\\nzaitsman: Hmm i found it to be the opposite. I never found need for associatedtype in enums, but i have a need for custom attributes and reflection all the time and sorely miss it.\\n\\nAlso, forced nullability checks are a PITA when youre coding against a backend you dont control where any number of fields may change type or just be missing\\ndippnerd: Check out [Property wrappers](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#ID617) for custom attributes and [mirror for reflection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mirror) (very creative with the naming /s)\\n\\nAs for associated types for enums, I use them constantly. Enums in general are anywhere that I can create a limited set of options for something, no need to worry about that one typo you made somewhere etc. Being able to add methods, computed properties, etc. just makes Enum a much bigger deal than C# really offers. \\n\\nAs for the backend, that just sounds like a badly designed backend. I know that we all inherit old code and such, but maybe its due for a rewrite. I dont see how C# would be any better, youll still be \\nzaitsman: That backend is called Salesforce. It is due for rewrite but its a billion dollar company :)))\\n\\nMirror doesnt let you set properties (keypaths sort of do) and property wrappers are no good for e.g. creating declarative layouts (again, i spend a lot of time dealing with the fact that everything can be nullable and e.g. a model may have 3 date properties all encoded differently so using `Codable` is a pain)\\ndippnerd: Ahh yeah, havent worked with Salesforce but I can imagine its full of legacy cruft. \\n\\nSwift still has some room to grow for sure, but its at least been evolving very rapidly and is pretty community driven. Still, I use both at work (though mostly C#) and theres plenty I wish both did differently. Swift could really use proper namespace support, or being able to name a file the same thing more than once. \\n\\nUltimately, theyre both great languages and both are still growing, but I do love the more modern feel of Swift and it not having to work around a bunch of legacy things. Optionals are great IMO, I wish C# had something more akin to how Swift handles it, as its still easy to hit a null you forgot to check and whatnot.\\nzaitsman: Swift has modules so you should totally be able to do that\\n\\n\\n\", \"In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called javahelp:\\nSSBM_ZAZU: Not how this sub works.

Browsing websites, watching youtube or Netflix would use up what, up to 20mbs at most? If you are downloading big files like games, 4k video files, raw pictures and photos the bigger your bandwidth faster you download file you wanted.\\n\\nAccess technologies are subscribed anyway, just look at most common FTTH scenario with GPON, you have 2,5gbs download and 1,2 gbs download shared between 30 to 60 people (128 in most extreme cases but that's rare) which all may have been sold 1gbs connection.\\nLynild: I am aware that the full bandwidth of most consumers isn't used all the time. But I don't find it unimaginable that 1000 people with 1G connections are downloading files (torrents etc.) almost 24 hours a day (or at least a given amount at the same time during a day). But in that case they might just be throttled ?\\nkariam_24: Why you think they would be doing that all day? That would be feasible with much lower bandwidth (like 1-20mbs), ff they would be downloading 24 hours a day with 1 gbs, try calculating how much storage space they would need to do it for 1 day, let alone a weeks or months. You are asking about something that just doesn't happens unless you are talking about companies or ISP customers but those are serviced using different infrastructure and technologies.\\nLynild: Valid point. But many people also upload. The 800G backbone is uplink and downlink I assume. And 24-hour upload is much more feasible for hardcore torrent users for example.\\nkariam_24: Most people don't really upload anything, they just got normal tcp traffic or sending pictures which are compressed anyway, that's why symmetric home broadband isn't a standard offering. Again same thing, you think all people using torrents and having 1gbs would upload at that bandwidth all the time?\\n\\nI think you mistake backbone or core for interconnects. Many small ISP companies (think wireless P2P) have often 1g or smaller connection to internet from bigger provider, even if they start offering 1gbs with fiber they don't really go higher then 10g connection for that internet pipe.\\nLynild: I am not saying many people will, but a 800G backbone (or core? I thought they were the same when talking ISP?) that are probably at a 200-300G capacity most of the time, which serves a million customers (give or take), is it that far fetched to think that \\\\~500-600 people will use their full bandwidth at the same period of time during a day. And not even that, each ISP have their threshold for max capacity, so 800G is not even possible with that threshold in mind. Therefore even fewer customers are needed to use their 1G connections at the same time.\\n\\nI might just be somewhat delusional. I have just started working at an ISP, and this is still something that boggles my mind, that so little capacity is actually used.\\nphantomtofu: Do you have data caps? They're pretty effective at discouraging 24/7 torrents, even if the customer uses a VPN to avoid liability. \\n\\nMy household includes three people who regularly download games, stream twitch/youtube/Netflix, and join video calls. We use about 800 GB/mo. \\n\\nIf my tipsy mobile calculations are correct, that's an average of 2.5 Mbps for a 30 day month. That would mean it would take 160k customers like me to consume half the capacity of 800Gb of peering, before accounting for the offload of caching within the ISP.\\nkariam_24: Data caps are USA practice, there are no such limits for cable/fiber/dsl broadband in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\", 'In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called linux:\\ndeathye: OBS for Linux clearly is not given the same attention as the Windows version.\\n\\nLuke points to a reality that many ignore.\\nTheBlackVipe: I was really shocked when seeing the problems linus was facing.

With the inclusion of AI, you can also determine shopping habits, high traffic areas, if people are focusing on specific end caps or ignoring others.\\n\\nBut even with theft, you can use AI to find people that might be hitting stores regularly, or large rings of people. Someone pocketing an item is small change, and for larger stores might not be worth the headache to catch and prosecute. But if you have repeat offenders, then it's worth it. And facial recognition is a quick way to build a profile like that without endangering staff, or having them divert attention.\\n\\nCameras, LP security people patrolling, greeters checking receipts, that's more of a deterrent through physical presence. Stops some from doing it that may be just \\nJimmyHavok: Haven't heard of any theft rings being shut down this way,  but I suppose if you ID them then keep them out of the store it doesn't matter if you prosecute them.\\nkingsumo_1: I don't have case studies, just what I've read up on, as far as what the goals are. There's a number of AI companies focused on the retail and industrial sectors where that is basically their purpose. Build case files, and then check against them.

This is because while comparing a number to an array or a string with non-numeric characters, javascript (rather frustratingly) decides to coerce all of them to booleans, causing them to counterintuitively match each other.

We could reduce need with wind, other energy storage solutions (like hydro), and nuclear, but those have higher costs, are usually also not on-demand, and have \\nHelkafen1: You\\'re looking at historical data. With battery prices plummeting, new batteries are nearly reaching [$100/MWh](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/battery-prices-fall-nearly-50-in-3-years-spurring-more-electrification-b/568363/).\\nRabidRoosters: And at $3 natural gas you can run a 500 mw combined cycle at $21 - $28 per mwh and have superb reliability with rotating mass.  Reliability is still the name of the game, not price.\\nHelkafen1: A [synchronous compensator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_condenser) provides the same service, and it can run on decarbonized electricity. Climate change etc.\\nRabidRoosters: A synchronous condenser absorbs mvars when voltage is high.  It injects mvars when voltage is low.  It does not provide rotating mass inertia to support a reliable grid.  Now it does help to correct voltage back to norms but it does not provide inertia.\\nHelkafen1: \"Because of the **rotating inertia** of the synchronous condenser, it can provide limited voltage support during very short power drops.\"\\n\\n[From a feasibility point of view, synchronous compensators could be placed throughout the network and the problem is solved, although this is not as cost effective as other solutions. Synchronous compensators (SC), also called synchronous condensers, are essentially synchronous generators without a prime mover to provide active power. This means they can provide all the ancillary services of conventional generators except those requiring active power, i.e. they can provide fault current, inertia and voltage support just like a synchronous generator. Active power is then provided by renewable generators and storage \\nRabidRoosters: In electrical engineering, a synchronous condenser (sometimes called a synchronous capacitor or synchronous compensator) is a DC-excited synchronous motor, whose shaft is not connected to anything but spins freely.[1] Its purpose is not to convert electric power to mechanical power or vice versa, but to adjust conditions on the electric power transmission grid. Its field is controlled by a voltage regulator to either generate or absorb reactive power as needed to adjust the grid\\'s voltage, or to improve power factor.\\n\\nSpins freely is not reliable, 3600 rpm rotating mass inertia.  Also, mvars are the 180 degree opposite on the sign curve of mws.  They are not the same.  \\n\\nAnyone else have a NERC cert and can back this up?  Its been a while since I took my \\nHelkafen1: Anyway, the next paragraph in the same paper indicates that other techniques are more likely to be used:\\n\\n&gt; Synchronous condensers are an established, mature technology, which provide a feasible upper bound on the costs of providing non-active-power-related ancillary services. The **inverters** of wind, solar and batteries already provide reactive power for voltage control and can provide the other ancillary services, including virtual or synthetic inertia, by programming the functionality into the inverter software [146]. Inverters are much more flexible than mechanics-bound synchronous generators and can change their output with high accuracy within milliseconds [147]. The reason that wind and solar plants have only recently been providing these \\nRabidRoosters: But solar and wind are not always there.  Ive seen 400 mws of wind fall to zero output in 15 minutes.  Thats the whole point.  They are renewable but not reliable.  Batteries are good but not at $100 mwh when you can quickly fire a natural gas unit within 10 minutes and have mws, and mvars, on the grid reliably with rotating mass.  3600 rpms.  Wind and solar arent doing that reliably yet without cheaper batteries.\\nHelkafen1: So your concern is about price, not about feasibility?\\ni_am_bromega: Not OP but the concern is about how to deliver reliability economically. Renewables cant compete at delivering reliability with current battery storage prices.\\nHelkafen1: Using renewables, [several illustrative pathways exist to reach 100 percent zero carbon electricity by 2035, which could keep electricity costs approximately the same as today](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pathways-to-100-Zero-Carbon-Power-by-2035-Without-Increasing-Customer-Costs.pdf)\\n\\nThe amount of batteries in a renewable grid is often vastly overestimated. Naive models ignore long distance transmission, or hydrogen storage, or sector coupling, or demand response.\\n\\nAn example: New York is building an additional [1GW line](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/12/06/news/construction-major-electricity-line-quebec-new-york-city-start-2020) with Quebec\\'s hydro. It replaces a lot of more expensive storage to balance NY\\'s renewables.\\ni_am_bromega: &gt; The technological pathways for eliminating the final 10 percent of GHG emissions from the electricity sector are inherently speculative at this time. This note uses todays best available information to assess whether it might be plausible to cost-effectively meet the goal of 100 percent clean power by 2035. It includes clearly documented assumptions about technological progress considered achievable in the next decade.\\n\\nThis modeling relies on technological advancements that have yet to be made. In 14 years you maybe could get all coal plants in the US replaced, but consider me skeptical that renewable technology advancement accelerates at a pace that can take natural gas plants offline that are being built now which are intended to last decades.\\n\\n\\n', 'In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called computervision:\\nsleeprzzz: Love this, great job!\\nthomsanson: Thank you :)\\n\\n\\n', \"In 2021, the conversation below took place in an online community called technology:\\nxMeowImDaddyx: They're sending the fire department after the house burned down already?\\n\\nCool\\nKatchafire69: Like seriously how long did that bogus claim from an idiotic dr come out ?

But, selling the product would mean they are making a profit margin.\\nrr777: I was always under the impression that particular ice cream machine was purposely designed and built to be finicky where the manufacturer would always be in the loop at a weekly level.  It might deliver a glorious product while it works, but it was intentionally built to not work 24/7, 12/3 or even less at that matter.   To have a volume quick service joint reduced to all robots, one hourly worker to maintain and clean, one manager to act important would be a wet dream to Mcdonalds world HQ.\\nLigerXT5: Till two or three things go down at the same time.

That\\'s an absurd as file creation is far more common and important than Move File. You\\'re just upset that the idea was shot down. They\\'ve made their decision, and it now probably counts as trolling to resubmit the same ticket over and over again.\\n\\nAlso, it makes sense to require an extension since most people are using source control so they will want to use the svn extension or a git extension to handle the renaming in a way that updates source control as well.\\nAduentix: I mainly care about renaming. And sadly people more often than not do not search closed issues before opening an new one. Just saying it is an actual requested feature.\\n\\nAnd no, of course I\\'m not suggesting removing creating a file, I am suggesting to finally add renaming a file.\\n\\nBut apparently this is only annoying me, which hey, it is what it is ^^.\\nits_a_gibibyte: How often are you renaming files in a project that doesn\\'t have any source control on it?\\nAduentix: Most likely close to zero, why? I saw the git rename command but assumed it does something different. Does it just rename the file? If yes, there goes my problem lol. Still think that File: Rename should be a thing though.\\nits_a_gibibyte: Yep, it renames the file AND updates git so git knows about the file rename. Otherwise it would look like a file deletion and a file creation and you\\'d lose the connection/history. Renaming a file without doing it properly in git/svn/mercurial is a bad idea.\\nAduentix: Does it work on untracked files? That would be rather important for me, and my refactoring. I never thought about the renaming in git. I just noticed that vscode aromatically detects it when staging. I assumed that would be a git feature, not one of vsc.\\n\\nSorry not at the PC, that is also why my spelling is so terrible.\\nits_a_gibibyte: No, I don\\'t believe there is a rename/mv command for untracked files. I\\'m just pointing out that it\\'s a much less common operation. They might leave it out because they don\\'t want people renaming files outside of source control by default. \\n\\n\"Git mv\" is a git feature, but has analogues in other source control providers. \"Svn mv\" for SVN, \"hg mv\" for mercurial, \"p4 move\" for perforce, etc. VScode doesn\\'t want to handle all of these options, they want the extension writers to handle the renaming. Sure, it loses the use case for files outside of source control, but that\\'s a small enough use case and you can add it back in with an extension if you want it.\\nAduentix: What I meant is that when I rename the file vscode file explorer (which will be removed as ot of scope shortly :P), and stage both the deleted and the new file, it will merge into a single \"renamed\" change in the staging area.\\n\\nThanks for taking your time though man, appreciate it :)\\nits_a_gibibyte: Yeah, reading about it now, it looks like git is a little more magical than the other source control providers. If you have a new file and a deleted file, it will try to figure out if it\\'s a rename by comparing source contents. So maybe a regular rename works in many cases for git, but doesn\\'t work for the other source control providers.\\n\\nAlso, still a weird workflow for git where you need to stage the new file after a vscode rename.

Rumors suggest that Apple has been working on another new Apple Silicon chip, this time for an updated version of the Mac Pro. This chip is expected to feature a CPU of up to 40 cores with a GPU of up to 128 cores. **If these rumors prove to be true (and I believe they will), this will be the end game for all of Apples competitors in the computer industry.**\\n\\n\\nIts probably going to be around $10,000 at best, and if it comes in at that price Id even be tempted to buy one myself for personal use. Thats competing at the Xeon and Threadripper level - which includes the existing Mac Pro, and is a small market segment where extreme performance has always been available at an \\nRazingsIsNotHomeNow: Hyperbolic is underselling it with a statement like that. Really, the end game for all competition?\\n\\nBy the time this gets released it will have to compete against 96 core, 192 thread AMD EPYC and Threadripper CPUs. It won't hold a candle to that. The only thing it will have is efficiency which doesn't matter at all in a single desktop. It matters in laptops when on battery and in supercomputers when scale is massive. This chip will never see server installation so as far as the CPU goes it's already beat. \\n\\nThe GPU is interesting if only to see if they manage to make it scale all the way up to 128 cores. If simply adding more cores scaled properly you would see a lot more double GPUs like the old Fury. More importantly than scaling is firmware and software \\nm-in: 96 core lol.

TBH it\\'s pretty darn stupid of them to expect you to install a VPN on a personal device in any way shape or form. Won\\'t stop them from canning (or suing) you citing \"unauthorized use\" when they find out or you are  inadvertedly liable for a breach. Even if you weren\\'t involved, you\\'re a great scapegoat now.\\n\\nBest defense is not agreeing to VPNs on your personal devices. If you can\\'t do your job without one, make them pay for your equipment. You know, like a company is supposed to.\\naw1cks: This is a very good point. I scrutinized my corporate policy and found no mention of any such clause in relation to personal devices - only corporate devices. Of course this will vary so one should take special care before doing any such thing.  \\nI completely agree regarding the point of it being quite foolish. Luckily I won\\'t be working there for much longer.\\nGrumpytux74: Yeah so I am gonna say it is in your user agreement policy for your corporate network. As a security professional I would expect your IDS to detect this. Essentially what you could do with this container is exfiltrate company data while attached to the corporate VPN. With no proof other than you word, as you have encrypted the traffic, you could be charged under the Computer Security Act. In addition to violating many federal laws if this setup is proven to be a cause of a breach you would be held personally responsible for any and all costs associated. This includes paying the company as well as LEO and court costs. I HIGHLY advise you to never use this on any corporate network.\\nBHSPitMonkey: &gt;Essentially what you could do with this container is exfiltrate company data while attached to the corporate VPN\\n\\nAs opposed to oh, say... just saving it to disk and then exfiltrating it after disconnecting? How is that any better?\\nsome_random_guy_5345: &gt; exfiltrating it after disconnecting\\n\\nWith corporate devices at least, USB ports are restricted from storage devices (or really any device that isn\\'t on a whitelist). And the OS will not connect to any network other than the corporate VPN. And the hard drive is encrypted.\\n\\nSo it\\'s a pretty high barrier to do so.
